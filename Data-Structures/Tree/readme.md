## BinaryTree and BinarySearchTree
*Author: Sue Tarazi*

---

### Problem Domain
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. Create a BinaryTree class with methods for PreOrder, InOrder and PostOrder traversal methods. Return values in an array. Create a BinarySearchTree class with a method called Add that takes in a value and creates a new node with that value in the correct location in the tree. Create a method Contains that accepts a value and returns a boolean (true if the value exists in the tree, false if it does not). 

Perform XUnit testing on all methods.
