***[Problem Domain for the Code Challenge]***

This challenge is about using a queues. The problem domain is to create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates on a first-in-first-out basis. There are two methods:

* enqueue(animal) - which addes a cat or a dog to the shelter
* dequeue(pref) - which returns either a cat or dog. If pref is not a cat or dog, it returns Null.
