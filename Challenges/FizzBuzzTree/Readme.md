### Problem Domain

Write a method called FizzBuzzTree that takes in a tree as an argument. Create a new tree with the same structure and modify the values as follows:
* if value is divisible by 3, replace the value with the string "Fizz"
* if value is divisible by 5, replace the value with the string "Buzz"
* if value is divisible by 3 & 5, replace the value with the string "FizzBuzz"
* if the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, return the number as a string
